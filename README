About
-----

InfoSel++ is a portable software package including a C++ library for feature selection.
Package include a infosel++ program with ready tens implemented well known feature 
selection algorithms (list implemented algorithm is bellow) and user friendly library
which can be used to created own algorithms based on probability.

InfoSel++ is library of the C++ based on the information theory developed at Silesian 
University of Technology in the Department of Computer Science and Department of Informatics 
at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun.

Feature selection is a fundamental problem in tasks like classification, data mining, 
image processing, conceptual learning. The feature selection problems refer to the task 
of identifying and selecting a useful subset of features. This subset is used to represent 
the goal from a larger set often redundant, possibly irrelevant, features with different 
associated measurement costs and/or risks.

Algorithms of feature subset selection can be classified into three categories based on 
whether algorithms of feature selections are done independently of the learning algorithm 
or not. First technique is called the filter approach, where feature selection is performed 
independently of the learning algorithm. When the goal is the maximization of the accuracy 
of a given feature subset, we often use for the good of the subset, relevance function and 
learnig algorithm. This defines the wrapper approach. The last type of selection approaches 
is the embedded approache, where only classification algorythms with different types 
of heuristic organization are used to search the important subset of features. 

Durning the processes of desining selection algorithm we must take four basic issues 
that determine the nature of search process into consideration:

 - a starting point in features space
 - an organization of the search
 - an evaluation strategy of the selected subset
 - a criterion for halting the search

This library is based on the information theory and especially on probability, which allow 
construct different types of feature selection algorythms. Our main goal is to provide 
capability to do following task easily and quikly:

 - implement and test new ideas and variants of feature ranking and selection algorithm.
 - generate simple statistics about attributes.
 - experiments with hybrid algorithm such as Markov Blanket, FCBF and other.
 - compare algorithms on different datasets (e.g. compare algorithms ADC,SUC and datasets from UCI Repository or GDataset)
 - joint to the another C++ libraries as part of them, but our library may be as a independent from of one.
